\begin{document}
This is my \emph{first} document prepared in \LaTeX. I typed it on \today.
\indent We have seen that to typeset something in \LaTeX, we type in the
text to be typeset together with some \LaTeX\ commands.
Words must be separated by spaces (does not matter how many)
and lines maybe broken arbitrarily.\\
\indent The end of a paragraph is specified by a \emph{blank line}
in the input. In other words, whenever you want to start a new
paragraph, just leave a blank line and proceed.\\
\indent The numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. are called natural numbers. According to
Kronecker, they were made by God;\ all else being the works of Man.

"Note" the difference in right and left quotes in \lq single
quotes\rq\ and \lq\lq double quotes\rq\rq.\\
\indent X-rays are discussed in pages 221--225 of Volume 3---the volume on
electromagnetic waves.

Maybe I have now learnt about 1\% of \LaTeX.\\

\section{Dividing the document}
\subsection{Example}
In this example, we show how subsections and subsubsections
are produced (there are no subsubsubsections). Note how the
subsections are numbered.
\subsubsection{Subexample}
Did you note that subsubsections are not numbered? This is so in the
\texttt{book} and \texttt{report} classes. In the \texttt{article}
class they too have numbers. (Can you figure out why?)
\paragraph{Note}
Paragraphs and subparagraphs do not have numbers. And they have
\textit{run-in} headings.
Though named ‘‘paragraph’’ we can have several paragraphs of text
within this.
\subparagraph{Subnote 1}
Subparagraphs have an additional indentation too.
\subparagraph{Subnote 2}
Subparagraphs have an additional indentation too.
\subparagraph{Subnote 3}
Subparagraphs have an additional indentation too.

\section{Tutorial III}
\subsection{Bibliography(Literaturverzeichnis)}
It is hard to write unstructured and disorganised documents using
\LaTeX˜\cite{les85}.It is interesting to typeset one
equation˜\cite[Sec 3.3]{les85} rather than setting ten pages of
running matter˜\cite{don89,rondon89}.\\If the author name is Alex and year 1991, the key can be coded as \textbf{\large{ale91}} or some
such mnemonic string.

\subsection{Displayed Text}
\subsubsection{Borrowed words}
Some mathematicians elevate the spirit of Mathematics to a kind of
intellectual aesthetics. It is best voiced by Bertrand Russell in the
following lines.
\begin{quote}
	The true spirit of ................................from which
	all great work springs.
\end{quote}
To show it more clearly.
\subsubsection{Marking Lists}
One should keep the following in mind when using \TeX
{\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\blacktriangleright$}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item First main item with Black triangle right{
         \renewcommand{\labelitemii}{\ding{42}}
         \renewcommand{\labelitemiii}{\ding{43}}
         \renewcommand{\labelitemiv}{\ding{45}}
         	\begin{itemize}
         		\item The ding 42 in the first level         		
         		\item The ding 42 in the first level
         		\begin{itemize}
         			\item The ding43 in the second level
         			\item the ding43 in the second level
         			\begin{itemize}
         				\item The ding45 item in the third level
         				\item The ding45 item in the third level
         		    \end{itemize}
         	    \end{itemize}
             \end{itemize}}
	\item Second main item with Black triangle right
	\end{itemize}
Being a program, \TeX\ offers a high degree of flexibility.\\

\noindent Such a numbered list is produced by the enumerate environment in \LaTeX. The above list
was produced by the following source.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item prepare a source file with the extension "tex"
    \item Compile it with \LaTeX to produce a "dvi" file
    \item Print the document using a "dvi" driver
\end{enumerate}
The three basic steps in producing a printed document using \LaTeX\ are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  First Item
	\item  Second Item
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Use a previewer 
		\item Edit the source if needed
		\item Recompile
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Third Item
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Descriptions and Definitions}
There is a example for the definitions layout.
\begin{description}
	\item[\TeX] A typesetting program
	\item[Emacs] A text editor and also
	\item[AbiWord] A word processor
	\item[$l$]
\end{description}
The real number $l$ is the least upper bound of the
set $A$ if it satisfies the following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(1)] $l$ is an upper bound of $A$
	\item[(2)] if $u$ is an upper bound of $A$, then $l\le u$
\end{enumerate}
The second condition is equivalent to
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(2)$'$] If $a<l$, then $a$ is not an upper bound of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
Let’s review the notation
\begin{itemize}
	\item $(0,1)$ is an \emph{open} interval
	\item $[0,1]$ is a \emph{closed} interval
\end{itemize}
